# Lorth

It's Like Forth but in Python. But I don't know actually know since I never programmed in Forth, I only heard that it's some sort of stack-based programming language. Lorth is also stack-based programming language. Which just makes it like Forth am i right?

##  Quick Start
```console
$ ./lorth.py sim ./examples/test.lorth
$ ./lorth.py com ./examples/test.lorth
$ ./output
```
